# Notes

## Compound Data Types

We have four compound data types in rust, which are:

- arrays
- tuples
- slices
- string (slice string)

### Arrays

Are fixed size collection of homogeneous (the same) types.

### Tuples

Are fixed siz collection of heterogenious (different) types.

### Slices

Dynamically sized view into a contangious (uninteruptted) sequence of element.

### Strings Vs String Slices (&str)

String are expandable, mutable (can push and delete) and are owned (not borrowed) string type. It is slow when you have alot of string stored or allocated in the heap memory.

String slice is a reference to a string stored somewhere in your code. They are immutable and are reference that prevent owning of data and hood for memory efficiency.

Rust cleans any memory allocated to any variable.
