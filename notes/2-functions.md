# Notes

The main function `fn main() {}` is the entry point of your rust program, thus other punctions must be written inside of it.

Every function in Rust starts with the keyword `fn` and next the function name, parameters and body. Any function or variables should be written in snake case e.g my_string.

Rust allows Hoisting - calling functions before it's declaration.

Like other programming languages, Rust function can return values.

Expression: Returns a value
Statement: Instruction that performs some action and does not return a value. Almost all statements in Rust end with ;

1. Variable declarations: `let x = 5;`
2. Function definitions: `fn foo() {};`
3. Control flow statements: `if condition { /* code */} else { /* code */}`, `while condition { /* code */ }`, etc.
