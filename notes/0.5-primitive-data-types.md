They are also called scalar data types:

- int
- float
- bool
- char

### Integer

Rust has signed (+ and -) and unsigned integer (only+) types of different sizes.
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128: Signed Integers.
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128: Unsigned Integers.

### Floats [Floating Point Types]

Represents decimal numbers. We have:

- f32
- f64

### Boolean Values

There are true or false values.

### Character Type
