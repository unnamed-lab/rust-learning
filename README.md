# Rust Learning

Welcome to **Rust Learning**, a repository documenting my journey and experiences as I learn the Rust programming language. This repository serves as a personal reference and a resource for anyone interested in exploring Rust through my lens.

## About the Repository

This repository contains:

- Notes on key Rust concepts and features.
- Code snippets and exercises demonstrating various aspects of Rust.
- Projects and challenges undertaken during my learning process.
- Links to useful resources, tutorials, and documentation.

## Goals

1. Master the fundamentals of Rust.
2. Build practical projects to apply Rust concepts.
3. Develop a deeper understanding of systems programming.
4. Share knowledge and insights with the community.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```sh
rust-learning/
|
├── notes/              # Notes on Rust concepts

## Why Rust?

Rust is a powerful systems programming language that emphasizes safety, performance, and concurrency. It is particularly well-suited for:

- Systems programming and embedded systems.
- High-performance applications.
- Applications where memory safety and concurrency are critical.
